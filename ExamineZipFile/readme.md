Code sample to get all folder and files in a .zip file. For visuals a TreeView is used.

- If there are folders in folders they are shown separately, close enough to similar nodes so that for inspection it's very easy to see what's in the .zip file.
- Exception handling is done via an event in the worker class where the form subscribes to the event.
