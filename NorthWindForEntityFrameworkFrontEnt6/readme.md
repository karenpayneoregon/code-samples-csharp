# About 

This project and the class project NorthWindForEntityFramework6 provide the ground work for digging into Entity Framework models and their details. No attempts made to create graphics.

- There are various gems not uncovered here but by taking time to review presented code and inspecting various items there is a good deal to be extracted.
- Some details are shown in the form while other details in Visual Studio's output window.
- No attempts/testing against various versions of Entity Framework, only tested with EF 6 code first with existing database.

For developers looking to get in the ground floor of working with models at runtime this will provide a decent foundation.

### Notes

There are tools out there if this is not what is desired.
